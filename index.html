            Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click Online Video,<br>
            you can paste in the embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for<br>
            the video that best fits your document. To make your document look professionally produced, Word<br>
            provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example,<br>
            you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar.
        </p>
        Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and<br>
        styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme,
        <br>
        the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply
        <br>styles, your headings change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons
        <br>that show up where you need them.
    
        <p>
            To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for layout options <br>
            appears next to it. When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column,<br>
            and then click the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts<br>
            of the document and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end,<br>
            Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.
